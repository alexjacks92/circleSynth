circleSynth
===========

A simple synthesizer using love2d (love2d.org), tested on Love 0.10.0 "Super Toast".

Click the screen, make a circle that grows and, eventually, pops.

To run:
- download love2d (https://love2d.org/)
- install love2d (https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started can be helpful)
- clone this repo

If on Mac or Linux:
- cd to the directory above this repo
- run this command: love circleSynth

If on Windows:
- open a file explorer at your love2d installation folder (likely C:/Program Files/LOVE)
- open another at your repository location
- drag and drop the repository folder onto love.exe

Start clicking around! Bright circles will appear and start dancing around,
like raindrops on a neon pool.
A couple fun key commands are included too. You can change the color of the circles using "r" for red, "b" for blue, "g" for green, or "a" to randomly cycle through colors. 
Pressing "c" enters what I've called "chaos mode", where random regular polygons are created instead of circles.
To exit, press escape.
