circleSynth
===========

A simple synthesizer using love2d (love2d.org)

Click the screen, make a circle that grows and, eventually, pops.

To run:
- download love2d (https://love2d.org/)
- install love2d (https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started can be helpful)
- clone this repo
- cd to the directory above this repo
- run this command: love circleSynth

Start clicking around! Bright circles will appear and start dancing around,
like raindrops on a neon pool.
