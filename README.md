circleSynth
===========

A simple synthesizer using love2d (love2d.org)

Click the screen, make a circle that grows and, eventually, pops.

To run:
1. download love2d and follow the instructions for installation
2. clone this repo
3. cd to the directory above this repo
4. run this command: love circleSynth

Start clicking around! Bright circles will appear and start dancing around,
like raindrops on a neon pool.

TODO: 
- add sounds (kind of important...)
