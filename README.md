circleSynth
===========

A simple synthesizer using love2d (love2d.org), tested on Love 0.10.0 "Super Toast".

Click the screen, make a circle that grows and, eventually, pops.

To run:
- download love2d (https://love2d.org/)
- install love2d (https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started can be helpful)
- clone this repo

If on Mac or Linux:
- cd to the directory above this repo
- run this command: love circleSynth

If on Windows:
- open a file explorer at your love2d installation folder (likely C:/Program Files/LOVE)
- open another at your repository location
- drag and drop the repository folder onto love.exe

Start clicking around! Bright circles will appear and start dancing around,
like raindrops on a neon pool.
